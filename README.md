This repository is inspired by [this article](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json)

> As long as the JSON string is only evaluated once, the JSON.parse approach is much faster compared to the JavaScript object literal, especially for cold loads.

## Object to JSON.parse

This plugin converts from object literal to JSON.parse

```js
// before
const data = { foo: 42, bar: 1337 };

// after
const data = JSON.parse('{"foo":42,"bar":1337}');
```

## How to use

### Install

```sh
$ npm install babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse -D
or
$ yarn add babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse -D
```

### setup `.babelrc`

```json
{
  "plugins": ["object-to-json-parse"]
}
```


### Options 
#### `minJSONStringSize` (`number`, defaults to `1024`)

The `minJSONStringSize` option will prevent the plugin from replacing an expression if the length of the JSON string given to `JSON.parse` is smaller than `minJSONStringSize`. For example, the following ensures all replacements have a string size of at least 1kb.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["object-to-json-parse", {
      "minJSONStringSize": 1024
    }]
  ]
}
```

## Caution!!
### this plugin may not be production ready
I just made this plugin for my understanding about AST and babel plugin.

### this plugin doesn't support partially JSON expression

I decided not to support partially JSON expression like below.

> Partially JSON expressions such as [notValid, {isValid:true}] ensuring {isValid:true} is transformed.

```
const data = { bar: invalid_object, foo: 'foo' }
â†“
const data = { bar: invalid_object, JSON.parse('{"foo": "foo"}')}
```

This is because I think most large objects are not partially JSON expressions. **JSON.parse() is much faster in the case that object is 10 kB or larger. Converting small object to JSON.parse expression is not meaningful.**

### this plugin produces output that only works in modern environments (e.g. Node.js v10+)

I don't care about some backwards compatibilities like [this issue](https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse/issues/12).
